# General utility scripts for DFT calculations.

Makes use of  the following libraries:
  1. https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html
  2. https://pymatgen.org\

Scripts so far:
  1. get_kpts: Gets a gamma centered kmesh of required kpoint density, measured by kpoints per reciprocal atom (KPRA).
  2. dos_plotting: To plot total, projected, orbital-projrcted density of states
  3. band_structure: Plot band structure
